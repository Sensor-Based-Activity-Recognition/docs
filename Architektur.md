# Architecture

The following flowchart shows the architecture of the system we built for the `Sensor based Activity Recognition` challenge over the course of this semester. It covers everthing from data collection & preprocessing, over model training using a dvc-based MLOps pipeline, to the model depolyment using an API and mobile app.
