## 3. Results

### What were the main findings of the study?
- Traditional ML/DL classifiers used:
There are a large number of classifier algorithms implemented for HAR. The classifier was generally one of the well-known methods such as 
Naive Bayesian (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision 
Tree (DT), Multilayer Perceptron (MP), Logistic Regression 
(LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Cortes and Vap-
nik 1995), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) (Huang et al. 
2006), ensemble learning algorithm of Random Forest (RF) 
(Breiman 2001), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (Lara 
and Labrador 2013) and deep learning approach of deep 
LSTM (Zhu et al. 2016)

### How well did the proposed solution perform?
- N/A

### Were there any limitations or challenges encountered during the study?
- N/A

## 4. Insights

### How can these insights be used to inform your own solution for sensor-based activity recognition?
- N/A
